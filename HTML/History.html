            <p style=" font-size: 20px; display: block;">The Early history of Cambodia follows the prehistoric and
                protohistoric
                development of Cambodia<br>
                as a country in mainland Southeast Asia. Thanks to archaeological work carried out since 2009 <br>
                this can now be traced back to the Neolithic period. As excavation sites have become more <br>
                numerous and modern dating methods are applied, settlement traces of all stages of human civil
                <br>development from neolithic Hunter-gatherer groups to organized preliterate societies are documented
                in the region.

            <h2>2.Funan Kingdom(1st Century-550/627)</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;"> Funan (Chinese call Chữ Nôm: 夫南, Khmer: ហ្វូណន, Vietnamese: Phù Nam) or Nokor
                Phnom (Khmer: នគរភ្នំ,<br>
                "Mountain Kingdom") was the name given by Chinese cartographers, geographers and writers to an ancient<br>Indianised state or, rather a loose network of states (Mandala)located in mainland Southeast Asia<br>centered on the Mekong Delta that existed from the first to sixth century CE. The name is found in<br>Chinese historical texts describing the kingdom, and the most extensive descriptions are largelybased<br>on the report of two Chinese diplomats, Kang Tai and Zhu Ying, representing the Wu Kingdom whosojourned<br>in Funan in the mid-3rd century AD.
                Funan is known in the modern languages of the region as វ្នំ Vnom (Old Khmer) or នគរភ្នំ Nokor Phnom<br>(Khmer), ฟูนาน (Funan) (Thai), and Phù Nam (Vietnamese), however, the name Funan is not found in any<br>texts of local origin from the period, and it is not known what name the people of Funan gave to their<br> polity. Some scholars argued that ancient Chinese scholars transcribed the word Funan from a word<br> related to the Khmer word bnaṃ or vnaṃ (modern: phnoṃ, meaning "mountain"), others however thought that<br>Funan may not be a transcription at all- rather it meant what it says in Chinese.<br> Like the very name of the kingdom, the ethno-linguistic nature of the people is the subject of much<br>
                discussion among specialists. The leading hypotheses are that the Funanese were mostly Mon–Khmer, or<br>that they were mostly Austronesian, or that they constituted a multi-ethnic society. The available<br> evidence is inconclusive on this issue. Michael Vickery has said that, even though identification ofthe<br>language of Funan is not possible, the evidence strongly suggests that the population was Khmer.</p>
