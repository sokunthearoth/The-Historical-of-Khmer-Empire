      <h1>ART OF CAMBODIA</h1>
      <p>The history of Cambodian art stretches back centuries to ancient times, but the most famous period is
        undoubtedly the Khmer art of the Khmer Empire (802–1431), especially in the area around Angkor and the mainly
        12th-century temple-complex of Angkor Wat, initially Hindu and subsequently Buddhist. After the collapse of the
        empire these and other sites were abandoned and overgrown, allowing much of the era's stone carving and
        architecture to survive to the present day. Traditional Cambodian arts and crafts include textiles, non-textile
        weaving, silversmithing, stone carving, lacquerware, ceramics, wat murals, and kite-making.

        Beginning in the mid-20th century, a tradition of modern art began in Cambodia, though in the later 20th century
        both traditional and modern arts declined for several reasons, including the killing of artists by the Khmer
        Rouge. The country has experienced a recent artistic revival due to increased support from governments, NGOs,
        and foreign tourists.

        In pre-colonial Cambodia, art and crafts were generally produced either by rural non-specialists for practical
        use or by skilled artists producing works for the Royal Palace. In modern Cambodia, many artistic traditions
        entered a period of decline or even ceased to be practiced, but the country has experienced a recent artistic
        revival as the tourist market has increased and governments and NGOs have contributed to the preservation of
        Cambodian culture.</p>

            Khmer architecture (Khmer: ស្ថាបត្យកម្មខ្មែរ), also known as Angkorian architecture is the architecture
            produced by the Khmers during the Angkor period of the Khmer Empire from approximately the later half of the
            8th
            century CE to the first half of the 15th century CE.

            The architecture of the Indian rock-cut temples, particularly the sculptures, were widely adopted in South
            Indian, and Indianised architecture of Cambodian, Annamese (Khmer) and Javanese temples (of the Greater
            India).
            In any study of Angkorian architecture, the emphasis is necessarily on religious architecture, since all the
            remaining Angkorian buildings are religious in nature. During the period of Angkor, only temples and other
            religious buildings were constructed of stone. Non-religious buildings such as dwellings were constructed of
            perishable materials such as wood, and so have not survived. The religious architecture of Angkor has
            characteristic structures, elements, and motifs, which are identified in the glossary below. Since a number
            of
            different architectural styles succeeded one another during the Angkorean period, not all of these features
            were
            equally in evidence throughout the period. Indeed, scholars have referred to the presence or absence of such
            features as one source of evidence for dating the remains.

            Khmer sculpture refers to the stone sculpture of the Khmer Empire, which ruled a territory based on modern
            Cambodia, but rather larger, from the 9th to the 13th century. The most celebrated examples are found in
            Angkor, which served as the seat of the empire, captivating in its civility, refinement and delight, open to
            all forms of life, is made in the image of the country and its inhabitants. Nevertheless, among the arts of
            the Far East, few are as accessible to the Western temperament. Its profound beauty impresses itself upon
            the spirit and sensibility without requiring prior study. Its sobriety, its horror of excess and its sense
            of balance and harmony allow it to attain universal value.” Thus wrote Madeleine Giteau, the distinguished
            member of the École française d’Extrême-Orient, in the introduction to her book Les Khmers in 1965.
            Currently, the largest museums of the West dedicate entire halls to Khmer sculpture, not to mention the
            enormous exhibition which took place first at the Galeries Nationales du Grand Palais in Paris and later at
            the National Gallery of Art in Washington in 1997.

            Because of destruction during recent war, few historic wat murals remain in Cambodia. In the 1960s,
            art historians Guy and Jacqueline Nafilyan photographed 19th-century murals, providing a record of this lost
            cultural heritage. The best known surviving murals are at the Silver Pagoda in Phnom Penh, Wat Rajabo in
            Siem Reap province, and Wat Kompong Tralach Leu in Kompong Chhnang Province. In the last decade, wat murals
            have seen a resurgence, but Cambodia's surviving older murals are generally more refined and detailed.

      <h1 id="b_4">ART MUSIC OF CAMBODIA</h1>
      <p class="paragraph">
        The music of Cambodia is derived from a mesh of cultural traditions dating back to the ancient Khmer Empire,
        India, China and the original indigenous tribes living in the area before the arrival of Indian and Chinese
        travelers. With the rapid Westernization of popular music, Cambodian music has incorporated elements from
        music around the world through globalization.

          <h2>Folk and classical music</h2>
          <p class="paragraph" style="text-align: justify;">
            Cambodian Art music is highly influenced by ancient forms as well as Hindu forms. Religious dancing, many of
            which depict stories and ancient myths, are common in Cambodian culture. Some dances are accompanied by a
            pinpeat orchestra, which includes a ching (cymbal), roneat (bamboo xylophone), pai au (flute), sralai
            (oboe), chapey (bass moon lute or banjo), gong (bronze gong), tro (fiddle), and various kinds of drums. Each
            movement the dancer makes refers to a specific idea, including abstract concepts like today (pointing a
            finger upwards). The 1950s saw a revival in classical dance, led by Queen Sisowath Kossamak Nearyrath.
    
            During the early 1970s, the Khmer Rouge of Cambodia committed genocide among the country's citizens. During
            their reign, an estimated "90% of Cambodia's musicians, dancers, teachers, and instrument makers" were
            killed, interrupting the transmission of cultural knowledge to following generations. The country has
            been undergoing revival ever since, with those remaining trying to perform, teach, research, and document
            what they can.
    
            The traditional music has had to compete with foreign music that has different tonal systems of scales and
            pitch frequency. Lack of a formal written-system of music theory for Cambodian music lent to a perception
            among modern Cambodians that the music was "incorrect", "out of tune" or "uncouth" when compared to western
            music or to Chinese music. Traditional music still exists today, but its survival is the result of formal
            government efforts(both the UNESCO and Cambodian) as well as academics. These have worked to organize
            knowledge of the Cambodian music system and its distinct traditions.
    
            Sam-Ang Sam, a Cambodian ethnomusicologist, wrote a brief introduction to Cambodian music on his website,
            part of his work to preserve knowledge Cambodian music and educating. He spoke of music in three different
            areas of Cambodia: villages, the court and temples. In each setting, music had a formal function or was
            entertainment. Village music included kar boran music for weddings, araak music for communication with
            spirits, and "ayai repartee singing, chrieng chapey narrative, and yike and basakk theaters." Court music
            had orchestras composed of a specific set of instruments. The pinpeat orchestra (consisting of gong chimes,
            xylophones, a metallophone, oboe and drums) accompanied the formal dance, masked play, shadow play and
            religious ceremonies. Less formal entertainment was played by a mohori orchestra. Temples had a "korng skor"
            ensemble (gongs and drums), as well as a pinpeat orchestra.
    
            Additionally, Sam-Ang Sam differentiates between music made by the mainstream Cambodians (Cambodian music)
            and the distinct music of ethnic minorities (part of the music of Cambodia). The latter includes music made
            by people living in Rattanakiri and Mundulkiri provinces, the Koulen and Cardamom ranges, and the vicinity
            "around the great lake (Tonle Sap)." Differences of language and religion help to create the separation
            between the different cultures. Ethnic groups include upland Mon-Khmer language groups (Pnorng, Kuoy (Kui),
            Por, Samre) whose music consists of "gong ensembles, drum ensembles, and free-reed mouth organs with gourd
            windchests." Other ethnic groups include Cham, Chinese, Vietnamese who all potentially could have music from
            their home cultures, but which is "unknown."

          <h2>PINPEAT</h2>
          <p>
            One of the traditional music forms is Pinpeat (Khmer: ពិណពាទ្យ), in which an orchestra or musical ensemble
            performs the ceremonial music of the royal courts and temples of Cambodia. The royal orchestra would
            accompany the classical ballets, both male (Lokhon Khol) and female (Apsara), as well as the Grand Theater
            of Shadows, the Sbek Thom. The orchestra consists of approximately nine or ten instruments, mainly wind
            and percussion (including several varieties of xylophone and drums). It accompanies court dances, masked
            plays, shadow plays, and religious ceremonies. The pinpeat is analogous to the piphat ensemble of
            Thailand.

            In recent years the instrument that gave the pinpeat its name, the pin, has been revived. The instrument was
            lost or abandoned around the 13 century A.D.
