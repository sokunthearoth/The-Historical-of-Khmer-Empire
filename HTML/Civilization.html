      <div class="intro">
        <p>Throughout Cambodia's long history, religion has been a major source of cultural inspiration. Over nearly two
          millennia, Cambodians have developed a unique Cambodian culture and belief system from the syncretism of
          indigenous animistic beliefs and the Indian religions of Buddhism and Hinduism. Indian culture and
          civilization, including its languages and arts reached mainland Southeast Asia around the 1st century AD. It
          is generally believed that seafaring merchants brought Indian customs and culture to ports along the Gulf of
          Thailand and the Pacific en route to trade with China. The Kingdom of Funan was most probably the first
          Cambodian state to benefit from this influx of Indian ideas. There is also French influence as well.</p>

        <p>The Angkorian architects and sculptors created temples that mapped the cosmic world in stone. Khmer
          decorations drew inspiration from religion, and mythical creatures from Hinduism and Buddhism were carved on
          walls. Temples were built in accordance with the rule of ancient Khmer architecture that dictated that a basic
          temple layout include a central shrine, a courtyard, an enclosing wall, and a moat. Khmer motifs use many
          creatures from Buddhist and Hindu mythology, like the Royal Palace in Phnom Penh, use motifs such as the
          garuda, a mythical bird in Hinduism.<span id="dots">....</span><span id="more"> The architecture of Cambodia
            developed in stages under the Khmer empire from the 9th to the 15th century, preserved in many buildings of
            the Angkor temple. The remains of secular architecture from this time are rare, as only religious buildings
            were made of stone. The architecture of the Angkor period used specific structural features and styles,
            which are one of the main methods used to date the temples, along with inscriptions.
            In modern rural Cambodia, the nuclear family typically lives in a rectangular house that may vary in size
            from four by six meters to six by ten meters. It is constructed of a wooden frame with gabled thatch roof
            and walls of woven bamboo. Khmer houses are typically raised as much as three meters on stilts for
            protection from annual floods. Two ladders or wooden staircases provide access to the house. The steep
            thatch roof overhanging the house walls protects the interior from rain. Typically a house contains three
            rooms separated by partitions of woven bamboo. The front room serves as a living room used to receive
            visitors, the next room is the parents' bedroom, and the third is for unmarried daughters. Sons sleep
            anywhere they can find space. Family members and neighbors work together to build the house, and a
            house-raising ceremony is held upon its completion. The houses of poorer persons may contain only a single
            large room. Food is prepared in a separate kitchen located near the house but usually behind it. Toilet
            facilities consist of simple pits in the ground, located away from the house, that are covered up when
            filled. Any livestock is kept below the house. Chinese and Vietnamese houses in Cambodian towns and villages
            are typically built directly on the ground and have earthen, cement, or tile floors, depending upon the
            economic status of the owner. Urban housing and commercial buildings may be of brick, masonry, or
            wood.</span><button onclick="myFunction()" id="myBtn">Read more</button></p>

          Buddhism has existed in Cambodia since at least the 5th century CE. Theravada Buddhism has been the Cambodian
          state religion since the 13th century CE (excepting the Khmer Rouge period), and is currently estimated to be
          the faith of 90% of the population. A smaller number of Cambodians, mostly of Vietnamese and Chinese descent,

        The long-popular traditional garment known as the Sampot, is an Indian-influenced costume which Cambodians have
        worn since the Funan era. Historically, Khmer clothing has changed depending on the time period and religion.
        From the Funan era to the Angkor Era, there was a strong Hindu influence in Cambodian fashion which favored
        wearing Sampots over the lower body and oftentimes nothing from the waist up except jewelry including bracelets
        and collars such as the Sarong Kor, a symbol of Hinduism.
        Some Cambodians still wear a religious style of clothing. Some Khmer men and women wear a Buddha pendant on a
        necklace. There are different pendants for different uses; some are meant for protection from evil spirits, some
        are meant to bring good luck.

        Clothing in Cambodia is one of the most important aspects of the culture. Cambodian fashion differs according to
        ethnic group and social class. Khmer people traditionally wear a checkered scarf called a Krama. The "krama" is
        what distinctly separates the Khmer (Cambodians) from their neighbors the Thai, the Vietnamese, and the
        Laotians. The scarf is used for many purposes including for style, protection from the sun, an aid (for the
        feet) when climbing trees, a hammock for infants, a towel, or as a "sarong". A "krama" can also be easily shaped
        into a small child's doll for play. Under the Khmer Rouge, krama of various patterns were part of standard
        clothing.

          adapted a well known dress as well as an expensive fashion style. Sampot is still well recognized among the
          royalty. Since the Udong period, most royalty have retained their dressing habits. Female royalty created the
          most attractive fashion. The lady always wears a traditional cape called sbai or rabai kanorng, which is
          draped over the left shoulder, leaving the right shoulder bare. Rarely was the cape worn over the right
          shoulder. The sbai or rabai kanorng would have been sumptuously fashioned in the old days in threads of
          genuine gold or silver.</p>

          Amok, a popular Cambodian dish Khmer cuisine is similar to that of its Southeast Asian neighbors. It shares
          many similarities with Thai cuisine, Vietnamese cuisine and Teochew cuisine. Cambodian cuisine also uses fish
          sauce in soups, stir-fried cuisine, and as dippings. The Chinese influence can be noted in the common chha
          (Khmer: ឆារ, Stir frying) and in the use of many variations of rice noodles. In Chinese-Cambodian cuisine, a
          popular dish is a "pork broth rice noodle soup", called kuy tieu (Khmer: គុយទាវ). It is similar to the Thai
          kuaitiao ruea and Thai kuai tiao sukhothai. Indian influenced dishes include many types of curry known as kari
          (Khmer: ការី) that call for dried spices such as star anise, cardamom, cinnamon, nutmeg and fennel as well as
          local ingredients like lemongrass, garlic, kaffir lime leaves, shallots and galangal that give dishes a
          distinctive Cambodian flavor.Banh Chaew (Khmer: នំបាញ់ឆែវ), the Khmer version of the Vietnamese Bánh xèo, is
          also a popular dish.

        Visual arts
        Main articles: Visual arts of Cambodia and Khmer sculpture
        The history of visual arts in Cambodia stretches back centuries to ancient crafts; Khmer art reached its peak
        during the Angkor period. Traditional Cambodian arts and crafts include textiles, non-textile weaving,
        silversmithing, stone carving, lacquerware, ceramics, wat murals, and kite-making. Beginning in the mid-20th
        century, a tradition of modern art began in Cambodia, though in the later 20th century both traditional and
        modern arts declined for several reasons, including the killing of artists by the Khmer Rouge. The country has
        experienced a recent artistic revival due to increased support from governments, NGOs, and foreign tourists.

        Cambodian dance can be divided into three main categories: classical dance, folk dances, and vernacular dances.
        Khmer Apsara dancers
        Khmer classical dance is a form of Cambodian dance originally performed only for royalty. The dances have many
        elements in common with Thai classical dance. During the mid-20th century, it was introduced to the public,
        where it now remains a celebrated icon of Khmer culture, often being performed during public events, holidays,
        and for tourists visiting Cambodia. Khmer classical dance is famous for its use of the hands and feet to express
        emotion; there are 4,000 different gestures in this type of dance.

        The Cambodian pinpeat ensemble is traditionally heard on feast days in the pagodas. It is also a court ensemble
        used to accompany classical dance for ritual occasions or theatrical events. The pinpeat is primarily made up of
        percussion instruments: the roneat ek (lead xylophone), roneat thung (low bamboo xylophone), kong vong touch and
        kong vong thom (small and large sets of tuned gongs), sampho (two-sided drum), skor thom (two large drums), and
        sralai (quadruple-reed instrument).

        Shadow Theatre

        Nang Sbek Thom figure plate.
        Nang Sbek (shadow theatre) (or Lakhaon Nang Sbek; Khmer) is closely related to the Nang Yai of Thailand, Wayang
        and Indonesia like the islands of Java and Bali, thus implying that Nang Sbek may have an Indonesian origin many
        centuries ago. Nang Sbek is also a dying art form and may disappear because of the decline in popularity due to
        the introduction of modern entertainment. Before the spread of modern entertainment such as movies, videos and
        television the Khmer enjoyed and watched shadow theatre apart from the other sources of entertainment available
        during that time. There are three kinds of shadow theatre in Cambodia:

        Nang Sbek Thom is an art that involves mime, song, music as well as dance and narration to the accompaniment of
        the Pinpeat orchestra. It most often features the Reamker.
        Nang Sbek Toch also called Nang Kalun and sometimes called Ayang (small shadow theatre) uses smaller puppets and
        a wide range of stories.
        Sbek Paor (coloured puppet theatre) uses coloured leather puppets.

        Film

        Main article: Cinema in Cambodia
        Cinema in Cambodia began in the 1950s; King Norodom Sihanouk himself was an avid film enthusiast. Many films
        were being screened in theaters throughout the country by the 1960s, which are regarded as the "golden age".
        After a decline during the Khmer Rouge regime, competition from video and television has meant that the
        Cambodian film industry is relatively weak today.
