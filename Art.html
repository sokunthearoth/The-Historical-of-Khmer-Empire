      <h1>ART OF CAMBODIA</h1>
      <p>The history of Cambodian art stretches back centuries to ancient times, but the most famous period is
        undoubtedly the Khmer art of the Khmer Empire (802–1431), especially in the area around Angkor and the mainly
        12th-century temple-complex of Angkor Wat, initially Hindu and subsequently Buddhist. After the collapse of the
        empire these and other sites were abandoned and overgrown, allowing much of the era's stone carving and
        architecture to survive to the present day. Traditional Cambodian arts and crafts include textiles, non-textile
        weaving, silversmithing, stone carving, lacquerware, ceramics, wat murals, and kite-making.

        Beginning in the mid-20th century, a tradition of modern art began in Cambodia, though in the later 20th century
        both traditional and modern arts declined for several reasons, including the killing of artists by the Khmer
        Rouge. The country has experienced a recent artistic revival due to increased support from governments, NGOs,
        and foreign tourists.

        In pre-colonial Cambodia, art and crafts were generally produced either by rural non-specialists for practical
        use or by skilled artists producing works for the Royal Palace. In modern Cambodia, many artistic traditions
        entered a period of decline or even ceased to be practiced, but the country has experienced a recent artistic
        revival as the tourist market has increased and governments and NGOs have contributed to the preservation of
        Cambodian culture.</p>

                  Khmer architecture (Khmer: ស្ថាបត្យកម្មខ្មែរ), also known as Angkorian architecture is the
                  architecture
                  produced by the Khmers during the Angkor period of the Khmer Empire from approximately the later half
                  of the
                  8th
                  century CE to the first half of the 15th century CE.

                  The architecture of the Indian rock-cut temples, particularly the sculptures, were widely adopted in
                  South
                  Indian, and Indianised architecture of Cambodian, Annamese (Khmer) and Javanese temples (of the
                  Greater
                  India).
                  In any study of Angkorian architecture, the emphasis is necessarily on religious architecture, since
                  all the
                  remaining Angkorian buildings are religious in nature. During the period of Angkor, only temples and
                  other
                  religious buildings were constructed of stone. Non-religious buildings such as dwellings were
                  constructed of
                  perishable materials such as wood, and so have not survived. The religious architecture of Angkor has
                  characteristic structures, elements, and motifs, which are identified in the glossary below. Since a
                  number
                  of
                  different architectural styles succeeded one another during the Angkorean period, not all of these
                  features
                  were
                  equally in evidence throughout the period. Indeed, scholars have referred to the presence or absence
                  of such
                  features as one source of evidence for dating the remains.

                  Khmer sculpture refers to the stone sculpture of the Khmer Empire, which ruled a territory based on
                  modern
                  Cambodia, but rather larger, from the 9th to the 13th century. The most celebrated examples are found
                  in
                  Angkor, which served as the seat of the empire, captivating in its civility, refinement and delight,
                  open to
                  all forms of life, is made in the image of the country and its inhabitants. Nevertheless, among the
                  arts of
                  the Far East, few are as accessible to the Western temperament. Its profound beauty impresses itself
                  upon
                  the spirit and sensibility without requiring prior study. Its sobriety, its horror of excess and its
                  sense
                  of balance and harmony allow it to attain universal value.” Thus wrote Madeleine Giteau, the
                  distinguished
                  member of the École française d’Extrême-Orient, in the introduction to her book Les Khmers in 1965.
                  Currently, the largest museums of the West dedicate entire halls to Khmer sculpture, not to mention
                  the
                  enormous exhibition which took place first at the Galeries Nationales du Grand Palais in Paris and
                  later at
                  the National Gallery of Art in Washington in 1997.

                  Because of destruction during recent war, few historic wat murals remain in Cambodia. In the 1960s,
                  art historians Guy and Jacqueline Nafilyan photographed 19th-century murals, providing a record of
                  this lost
                  cultural heritage. The best known surviving murals are at the Silver Pagoda in Phnom Penh, Wat Rajabo
                  in
                  Siem Reap province, and Wat Kompong Tralach Leu in Kompong Chhnang Province. In the last decade, wat
                  murals
                  have seen a resurgence, but Cambodia's surviving older murals are generally more refined and detailed.

                  The music of Cambodia is derived from a mesh of cultural traditions dating back to the ancient Khmer
                  Empire,
                  India, China and the original indigenous tribes living in the area before the arrival of Indian and
                  Chinese
                  travelers. With the rapid Westernization of popular music, Cambodian music has incorporated elements
                  from
                  music around the world through globalization.

                </p>
                <h2 style="text-align: left;">FOLK AND CLASSICAL MUSIC</h2>
                <p>
                  Cambodian Art music is highly influenced by ancient forms as well as Hindu forms. Religious dancing,
                  many of
                  which depict stories and ancient myths, are common in Cambodian culture. Some dances are accompanied
                  by a
                  pinpeat orchestra, which includes a ching (cymbal), roneat (bamboo xylophone), pai au (flute), sralai
                  (oboe), chapey (bass moon lute or banjo), gong (bronze gong), tro (fiddle), and various kinds of
                  drums. Each
                  movement the dancer makes refers to a specific idea, including abstract concepts like today (pointing
                  a
                  finger upwards). The 1950s saw a revival in classical dance, led by Queen Sisowath Kossamak Nearyrath.

                  During the early 1970s, the Khmer Rouge of Cambodia committed genocide among the country's citizens.
                  During
                  their reign, an estimated "90% of Cambodia's musicians, dancers, teachers, and instrument makers" were
                  killed, interrupting the transmission of cultural knowledge to following generations. The country has
                  been undergoing revival ever since, with those remaining trying to perform, teach, research, and
                  document
                  what they can.
                <h2 style="text-align: left;">CAMBODIAN ROCK AND POP</h2>
                <p>
                  Starting in the late 1950, Head of State Norodom Sihanouk, a musician himself, encouraged the
                  development
                  of popular music in Cambodia. Initially, pop records from France and Latin America were imported into
                  the
                  country and became popular, inspiring a flourishing music scene based in Phnom Penh and led by singers
                  like
                  Ros Serey Sothea, Pen Ran or Sinn Sisamouth, with hits such as "Violon Sneha". By the late 1960s and
                  early 1970s, the scene was further influenced by Western rock and roll and soul music via U.S. armed
                  forces
                  radio that had been broadcast into nearby South Vietnam. This resulted in a unique sound in which
                  Western pop and rock were combined with Khmer vocal techniques.

                  Many of the most important singers of this era perished during the Khmer Rouge genocide. Western
                  interest in
                  the popular Cambodian music of the 1960s-70s was sparked by the bootleg album Cambodian Rocks in
                  1996, which in turn inspired the 2015 documentary film.

                  Dance in Cambodia (Khmer: របាំ robam) consists of three main categories: classical dance of the royal
                  court,

                <p>
                  Cambodia's premier performing art form is Khmer classical dance, or Robam Preah Reach Trop, a highly
                  stylized dance form originating from the royal courts. Originally performed and maintained by
                  attendants of

                  Theatre of Cambodia known as Lakhon (Khmer: ល្ខោន) is composed of many different genres. There are
                  three main categories: classical, folk, and modern. Many forms of theatre in Cambodia incorporates
                  dance movement into performances and are referred to as dance dramas.

                <p>
                  <b> Lakhon Preah Reach Trop</b> (Khmer: ល្ខោនព្រះរាជទ្រព្យ, also known as the Royal Ballet of Cambodia) is the
                  main form of classical dance drama performed in Cambodia. It is also referred to as Lakhon luong and
                  Lakhon Kbach Boran Khmer in Cambodia. This dance drama is the most refined of all theatre in Cambodia
                  and was particularly patronized by royalty. It is heavily stylized with gestures and postures meant to
                  entrance the viewer.
                  <br><br>
                  <b>Lakhon Khol</b> (Khmer: ល្ខោនខោល, Masked Drama Dance) is a masked dance drama featuring male performers.
                  The repertoire consists solely of material from Reamker. The choreography is styled similarly to the
                  Royal Ballet of Cambodia although not as refined and is performed along to narrators and a pinpeat
                  ensemble.
                  <br><br>
                  <b>Lakhon Pol Srey</b> (Khmer: ល្ខោនពោលស្រី, Female Narrative Theatre) is a dance drama akin to the lakhon
                  khol; the performers being female however. Both forms combine classical theatre and dance and are
                  accompanied by the traditional pin peat orchestra. Unlike Lakhon Khol, which use a separate group of
                  narrators, lakhon pol srey dancers take turns narrating while other members continue to dance. The
                  dancers often lift their masks and narrate directly to the audience. It is believed to have originated
                  from the Kingdom of Oudong between 1618-1628 during the reign of King Chey Chettha II. In 1878, Ms.
                  Chinh, a great art teacher from Koh Oknheatey, came to teach Lakhon Pol Srey in Wat Keansvay Krao.
                  Today, one of her students, a 70-year-old woman, Ms. Chea Samut, has taken a lead role in reviving
                  lakhaon poul srei and currently teaches this drama form to students at Wat Keansvay Krao, after having
                  disappeared for more than 40 years.
                  <br><br>
                  <b>Lakhon Berk Bat</b> is a lost theatre form in Cambodian Court. It is believed to have originated in the
                  Post-Angkor period. Some older Royal Ballet dancers also recalled hearing that it was created in the
                  late Angkor period, but little is known as to why it was discontinued. Evidence reveals that the drama
                  was re-instituted during the reign of Oudong city by King Norodom in the late 1950s. The form
                  disappeared again in the late 1970s during the time of the Khmer Rouge regime. It is assumed that
                  lakhon berk bat was only performed in the presence of royal or noble families due to the dancers
                  elaborate and expensive costumes and jewelry. As the art form emphasized beauty, character and
                  technique, performers were expected to be not only beautiful, but to be able to act, sing, and speak
                  well. The ability to sing unaccompanied was especially prized.

                <p>
                  <b>Yike </b>is dance drama with strong influences from Cham and Malay culture. It utilizes a style of singing
                  reminiscent of the Islamic traditions of the Cham and Malay people. It incorporates basic dance
                  movements with the hands swaying back and forth, although not as stylized as classic forms. The music
                  consists of rebana drums and other Khmer instruments such as the tro.
                  <br><br>
                  <b>Lakhon bassac or basak</b> is one of the most popular folk theatre in Cambodia. It takes its name from the
                  districts adjoining in the Bassac river in the former Cambodian province of Preah Trapeang, now known

            Khmer architecture (Khmer: ស្ថាបត្យកម្មខ្មែរ), also known as Angkorian architecture is the architecture
            produced by the Khmers during the Angkor period of the Khmer Empire from approximately the later half of the
            8th
            century CE to the first half of the 15th century CE.

            The architecture of the Indian rock-cut temples, particularly the sculptures, were widely adopted in South
            Indian, and Indianised architecture of Cambodian, Annamese (Khmer) and Javanese temples (of the Greater
            India).
            In any study of Angkorian architecture, the emphasis is necessarily on religious architecture, since all the
            remaining Angkorian buildings are religious in nature. During the period of Angkor, only temples and other
            religious buildings were constructed of stone. Non-religious buildings such as dwellings were constructed of
            perishable materials such as wood, and so have not survived. The religious architecture of Angkor has
            characteristic structures, elements, and motifs, which are identified in the glossary below. Since a number
            of
            different architectural styles succeeded one another during the Angkorean period, not all of these features
            were
            equally in evidence throughout the period. Indeed, scholars have referred to the presence or absence of such
            features as one source of evidence for dating the remains.

        <div class="blog-scrip1">

            Khmer sculpture refers to the stone sculpture of the Khmer Empire, which ruled a territory based on modern
            Cambodia, but rather larger, from the 9th to the 13th century. The most celebrated examples are found in
            Angkor, which served as the seat of the empire, captivating in its civility, refinement and delight, open to
            all forms of life, is made in the image of the country and its inhabitants. Nevertheless, among the arts of
            the Far East, few are as accessible to the Western temperament. Its profound beauty impresses itself upon
            the spirit and sensibility without requiring prior study. Its sobriety, its horror of excess and its sense
            of balance and harmony allow it to attain universal value.” Thus wrote Madeleine Giteau, the distinguished
            member of the École française d’Extrême-Orient, in the introduction to her book Les Khmers in 1965.
            Currently, the largest museums of the West dedicate entire halls to Khmer sculpture, not to mention the
            enormous exhibition which took place first at the Galeries Nationales du Grand Palais in Paris and later at
            the National Gallery of Art in Washington in 1997.

            Because of destruction during recent war, few historic wat murals remain in Cambodia. In the 1960s,
            art historians Guy and Jacqueline Nafilyan photographed 19th-century murals, providing a record of this lost

            Siem Reap province, and Wat Kompong Tralach Leu in Kompong Chhnang Province. In the last decade, wat murals
            have seen a resurgence, but Cambodia's surviving older murals are generally more refined and detailed.

        <p class="paragraph">
          The music of Cambodia is derived from a mesh of cultural traditions dating back to the ancient Khmer Empire,
          India, China and the original indigenous tribes living in the area before the arrival of Indian and Chinese
          travelers. With the rapid Westernization of popular music, Cambodian music has incorporated elements from

          <h2>Folk and classical music</h2>
          <p>
            Cambodian Art music is highly influenced by ancient forms as well as Hindu forms. Religious dancing, many of
            which depict stories and ancient myths, are common in Cambodian culture. Some dances are accompanied by a
            pinpeat orchestra, which includes a ching (cymbal), roneat (bamboo xylophone), pai au (flute), sralai
            (oboe), chapey (bass moon lute or banjo), gong (bronze gong), tro (fiddle), and various kinds of drums. Each
            movement the dancer makes refers to a specific idea, including abstract concepts like today (pointing a
            finger upwards). The 1950s saw a revival in classical dance, led by Queen Sisowath Kossamak Nearyrath.

            During the early 1970s, the Khmer Rouge of Cambodia committed genocide among the country's citizens. During
            their reign, an estimated "90% of Cambodia's musicians, dancers, teachers, and instrument makers" were
            killed, interrupting the transmission of cultural knowledge to following generations. The country has
            been undergoing revival ever since, with those remaining trying to perform, teach, research, and document
            what they can.
          <h2>Cambodian rock and pop</h2>
          <p>
            Starting in the late 1950s, Head of State Norodom Sihanouk, a musician himself, encouraged the development
            of popular music in Cambodia. Initially, pop records from France and Latin America were imported into the
            country and became popular, inspiring a flourishing music scene based in Phnom Penh and led by singers like
            Ros Serey Sothea, Pen Ran or Sinn Sisamouth, with hits such as "Violon Sneha". By the late 1960s and
            early 1970s, the scene was further influenced by Western rock and roll and soul music via U.S. armed forces
            radio that had been broadcast into nearby South Vietnam. This resulted in a unique sound in which
            Western pop and rock were combined with Khmer vocal techniques.

            Many of the most important singers of this era perished during the Khmer Rouge genocide. Western interest in
            the popular Cambodian music of the 1960s-70s was sparked by the bootleg album Cambodian Rocks in
            1996, which in turn inspired the 2015 documentary film.

            banquet parties.
